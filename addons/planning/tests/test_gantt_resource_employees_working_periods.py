        Currently gantt_resource_employees_working_periods method supplies data to Gantt Model.
        The goal is check if the method correctly filters contracts.
        Test Goals -
        1). Contract in State "draft" is only chosen if its kanban_state is in "done"
        2). Contracts in States "open" and "close" are chosen regardless of the kanban_state
        3). Any other type of combination is not accepted and takes its working period as default scale time
        Here the context dates refer to dates we from gantt view through the RPC request sent. These refer to
        start date and end dates of the scale. If the scale is week, the starting date of week is default_start_datetime
        and end date if weeek is default_end_datetime.
